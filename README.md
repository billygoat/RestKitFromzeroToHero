# About

This repository contains code for my talk "RestKit - From Zero to Hero". 

It shows how to use RestKit to...

* ... fetch simple resource such as images
* ... fetch XML data and map it to Objective-C classes
* ... do the same with JSON data, without even changing the code!
* ... setup routes for RESTful resource access
* ... use CoreData to cache data offline
* ... authenticate your app against your backend
* ... map advanced data types such as dates
* ... seed your offline database so your users can use your app right away, without even having to connect to the internet
